# Welcome to Project Spirare

Project Spirare defines a versatile file format called POML for describing 3D content.
POML is designed to be independent of any specific game engine or application and can be dynamically loaded by applications.

Additionally, as standard applications for utilizing POML, we provide a content creation application called "Spirare Editor" and a content viewing application called "Spirare Browser."
In Spirare Editor, users can create 3D content through a GUI, and the content is saved as a POML file.
Spirare Browser can load and display 3D content from POML files.
By using Spirare Editor and Spirare Browser, users can easily create and display simple AR/VR content.

Furthermore, the code for these applications, as well as the libraries used within them, are available as open-source software (OSS).
Therefore, customization according to different use cases is also possible.
